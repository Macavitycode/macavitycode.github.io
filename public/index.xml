      <title>On Note Taking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having started a Masters&amp;rsquo; course recently, I found myself once again in need&#xA;of a good note taking application. As a student I&amp;rsquo;d gone through a couple of&#xA;options before -  &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, using manually set up sync&#xA;across my devices - but I was looking to change somethings.&#xA;I jotted down some requirements for a note taking app, namely&#xA;that it needed to (a) work with markdown files (b) be free and open source.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t mind having to pay for a piece of software I use as long as I can align&#xA;myself with the values. As a proponent of free and open source software I am&#xA;happy to support projects I use. Thus, this got me interested in an another&#xA;fairly popular app that met all these criteria: &lt;a href=&#34;https://logseq.com/&#34;&gt;Logseq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Soft Robotics Grippers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soft robotics was a course I took taught by &lt;a href=&#34;https://in.linkedin.com/in/jeane-d-souza-2b267119&#34;&gt;Dr. Jeane D`Souza&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;in my seventh semester of my college. The course itself proved to be mostly&#xA;theory oriented, and the reason for that became apparent very soon. It&amp;rsquo;s a&#xA;completely foreign paradigm to someone studying conventional robotics - working&#xA;with rigid structures, deterministic frames and kinematics around those - soft&#xA;robotics seems like an weird pseudoscience, requiring feedback control and real&#xA;world testing even for prototypes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drone Simulations</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my Bachelors in Mechatronics, at an event on robotics developments in India,&#xA;I met &lt;a href=&#34;https://in.linkedin.com/in/kvlikhin&#34;&gt;Likhin KV&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;a founder at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.haveliuavs.com/&#34;&gt;Haveli UAVs&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;Haveli UAVs was a startup working on drones in agriculture.&#xA;I really enjoyed talking to Likhin, and apparently so did he,&#xA;as he offered me an internship to work with them to explore my interests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem statement was to make a roadmap (and implement as much of it&#xA;as possible) for the autonomous navigation of drones in GPS-denied outdoor&#xA;situations. This was an interesting problem statement because outdoor drone&#xA;navigation is essentially a solved problem, provided you use some form of GPS.&#xA;This would not be feasible for this case because the locations at which they&#xA;planned to use the drones had very sparse GPS coverage, and they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to&#xA;rely on it more than necessary (this was before NavIC solved this problem).&#xA;This got me started on simulations with drones and working with a large&#xA;suite of software and hardware architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This writeup was copied from my old website, which no is longer functional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.solarmobilmanipal./&#34;&gt;SolarMobil&lt;/a&gt; is a student project under&#xA;Manipal Institute of Technology which focuses on building and manufacturing&#xA;an solar powered electric car for &lt;a href=&#34;https://esvc.in/&#34;&gt;ESVC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ESVC is Asia&amp;rsquo;s biggest solar car event, Except for the motors and wheels (which&#xA;are proprietary) they build everything else from scratch.&#xA;The sheer amount of design work that goes into the project is phenomenal.&#xA;I was a member of the automation subsystem, meaning my work was focused around&#xA;getting the car to autonomously navigate through one of the challenges in the&#xA;competition.&#xA;The challenge was to navigate the car completely autonomously through a course&#xA;marked by having small orange cones on both sides.&#xA;The design limitations on it were that the coded stack needed to be cheap,&#xA;easy to use and understand and for initial setup use &lt;strong&gt;only a RGB camera&lt;/strong&gt;.&#xA;Of course, the stack needed to integrate with the rest of the car in terms of&#xA;mechanical and electronics design.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ackermann Drive Simulation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: This writeup was copied from my old website, which no is longer functional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to get a cone following algorithm to be implemented using just a normal RGB camera.&#xA;The competition this was made for is the same as &lt;a href=&#34;https://macavitycode.com/posts/solar_mobil/&#34;&gt;SolarMobil&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;I used the linearity of the relation of area occupied on screen vs. the distance of the object.&#xA;I get a representation of the distance here rather than the actual physical distance with this method.&#xA;The scikit-spatial library is a huge help as it simplifies a lot of the involved mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stance Classification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my second year of Bachelors in Mechatronics, I got very interested in AI.&#xA;The progress in AI has been extremely quick, and the extension of the field&#xA;to robotics is inevitable. I with a group of friends participated in a&#xA;competition outside the college&amp;rsquo;s purview, called the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9222464/proceeding&#34;&gt;IEEE BigMM Data Challenge (2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a team we were all first and second years, who with considerable effort&#xA;had managed to teach ourselves the basics of python and machine learning.&#xA;The problem statement given was to do a stance classification based on tweets&#xA;in multiple categories, with no other outside information. We came second in&#xA;the overall challenge, and IEEE graciously provided us the opportunity to share&#xA;our research work in the journal (&lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9232641&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
